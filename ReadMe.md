Hi There!

This is a "Snake" game made by me using random module and pygame module in pythyon. You can play this game by downloading the random and pygame module from your terminal. The code to download the modules is given below:

For random module:
    
    pip install random


For pygame module:
    
    pip install pygame


This game also has a cheat code. Whenever you will press "q" the score of the game will increase by 10. "highscore.txt" is the file which stores the highscore of the game so you should never delete it.
